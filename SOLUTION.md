# Solution Description

## Used Tech Stack

I used given tech stack to implement the solution, but I added some libraries to make the solution more robust.

- vite: to build the project
- swc: to transpile the code
- styled-components: to style the components
- zustand: to manage the state

### Why I used styled-components instead of emotion?

I used styled-components because I am more familiar with it.

### Why I used zustand instead of redux or something?

I used zustand because it is a state management library that is very easy to use and it is very lightweight.


## Project Structure

This project is a little React project, so it has a simple structure.

- `src`: contains the source code
  - `components`: contains the components
  - `hooks`: custom hooks
  - `pages`: pages
  - `store`: store
  - `types`: types
  - `utils`: utility functions
  - `models`: typescript models

## Future Improvements

- Add tests
- Add resource managing server
